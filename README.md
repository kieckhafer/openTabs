# openTabs

A tab organizer.

## Description

openTabs gives you a count of your open tabs, windows, and pinned tabs, and allows you to combine all windows into one, sort tabs alphabetically, and extract all tabs from the current domain into their own new window.

Inspired by (and originally forked from) [i-a-n's tabnarok](https://github.com/i-a-n/tabnarok), which is used to display the number of Chrome tabs you have open, the number of Chrome windows open, and the number of those tabs which are pinned, openTabs expands upon this functionality by adding the ability to merge, extract, and sort tabs.

## Installation instructions

[openTabs is available on the Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ldnbelnhmpjjlibfandpolkgfkgombma), or by downloading this repository and installing the folder as an `unpacked extension` in Chrome.
